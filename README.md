# Shopify Challenge
Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question - This program attempts to solve the challenge outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eg3sJTOwtyFhDopKedRD6142CFkDfWp1QvRKXNTPIOc/edit#) for the winter 2021 intership positions.

# A not so secret message to Shopify's recruiter
Hi, my name is Larry, a final year university student from Singapore. You may have realized that this project was started a couple of months ago. This is because I have just found out about this internship opportunity with Shopify (21/9/2021) and the deadline for submitting an application is only a few hours away. A wise man once said that you miss a 100% of the shots you don't take. Hence, this is an attempt to use one of my recent e-commerce related passion project as the solution to the challenge question.

# Business Overview of Project
This project was inspired by TikTokâ€™s ability to drive interest in commerce products! Hence, I designed and created a link-in-bio website that focuses on allowing affiliate marketing influencers to easily import and tag their TikTok videos on the website! This is an example of a [real-life usecase](https://vosh.club/pattywhoa)!

# Technical Overview of Project
The site allows user to upload both images and videos. (media blob is uploaded to s3 bucket, url of media is saved in database)
Tech Stack: React, Express, NodeJS, and MongoDB
