# Shopify Challenge
Shopify Developer Intern Challenge Question - This program attempts to solve the challenge outlined [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eg3sJTOwtyFhDopKedRD6142CFkDfWp1QvRKXNTPIOc/edit#) for the winter 2021 intership positions.

# A not so secret message to Shopify's recruiter
Hi, my name is Larry, a final year university student from Singapore. You may have noticed that this project was started a couple of months ago. This is because I have just found out about this internship opportunity with Shopify (21/9/2021) and the deadline for submitting an application is only a few hours away. A wise man once said that you miss a 100% of the shots you don't take. Hence, this is an attempt to use one of my recent e-commerce related passion project as a fitting solution to the challenge question.

# Business Overview of Project
This project was inspired by TikTokâ€™s ability to drive interest in commerce products! Hence, I designed and created a link-in-bio website that focuses on allowing affiliate marketing influencers to easily import and tag their TikTok videos on the website! This is an example of a [real-life usecase](https://vosh.club/pattywhoa)!

# Technical Overview of Project
The site allows user to upload both images and videos. (media blob is uploaded to s3 bucket, url of media is saved in database)
The user can easily add and edit the products to display on the site.
Viewers can filter the videos to watch via the product categories.

Tech Stack: React, Express, NodeJS, and MongoDB
